#### Challenge Description:

> Good job! Your work helped us avert greater damage at the victim. Unfortunately the group came back and infiltrated another host. This time they hacked into the customer's central git repository host, installed a hook that enforces their source code indentation ideology and kicked the legitimate admins out.

> Before the admins lost access they were able to create a snapshot. With their consent, can you find a way back into the host at: `tabnabbed.challenges.adversary.zone:23230`

#### Write-Up:

For this challenge we have to exploit a buffer overflow in binary.

We're given a `.qcow2` qemu image with the host we need to exploit and an ssh key. This took me an embarassingly long time to access until I finally [mounted the image](https://gist.github.com/shamil/62935d9b456a6f9877b5) and changing the root password. It is a developer box running [gitolite](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html), which allows users to run a few ssh commands and use git over ssh *without* getting a shell.   

```
$ ssh -i developers.key -p 23230 git@localhost help
hello devs, this is git@githost running gitolite3 v3.6.12-0-gf073598 on git 2.27.0

$ ssh -i developers.key -p 23230 git@localhost info
hello devs, this is git@githost running gitolite3 v3.6.12-0-gf073598 on git 2.27.0

 R W	hashfunctions
```

We have read/write access to a repo called `hashfunctions` so we can clone and commit files to it. 

```
$ cat ~/.ssh/config
Host tabnab
     HostName localhost
     Port 23230
     IdentityFile ~/path/to/developers.key
$ git clone ssh://git@tabnab/hashfunctions

```

We are told that the attackers added a malicious hook, so checking out all the [server side hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) and we see Space Jackal's work in `/home/git/repositories/hashfunctions.git/hooks/post-receive`: a short python script to run the program `/detab` on all files pushed to the repository and then pushing them back. Here is a snippet - the files are passed to `/detab` through standard input.  

```Python
def file_desinfect(path):
    with open(path, "rb") as reader:
        content = reader.read()

    with subprocess.Popen(["/detab"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE) as proc:
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate(input=content)

    with open(path, "wb") as writer:
        writer.write(stdout)

def d(path):
    for entry in os.listdir(path):
        fpath = os.path.join(path, entry)

        if os.path.isdir(fpath) and not os.path.basename(fpath).startswith("."):
            d(fpath)

        if os.path.isfile(fpath):
            file_desinfect(fpath)
```

Copying over `/detab` and looking at it in a reverse engineering program (I'm using Cutter with r2-ghidra decompiler). Here is main decompiled:


![main decompiled](images/jackel-tab-main-decomp.png)

A bit garbled, but mostly just checks commandline arguments and then runs `vaccinate`. Here's `vaccinate` decompiled:

![vaccinate decompiled](images/jackel-tab-vacc-decomp.png)

This decompiled code is a bit more straightforward. In the main loop, vaccinate runs `fgetc` and stores it in the buffer `acStack544` at the index `stream`. `var_4h` is a newline check, at the start and on any newline it is set to 1. If after a newline `fgetc` returns a tab, there is a nested for loop to instead write a fixed number of spaces to the buffer. And at the end, if the index of the buffer is ever equal to `0x200`, it writes the buffer to stdout and sets the index back to 0.

So the buffer overflow is clear - the index checks if the buffer is ever *equal* to `0x200` not greater than. Andthe index doesn't always go up by one every loop iteration, we can increment the index multiple times by sending a tab after a newline. Let's try to bypass the buffer overrun check:

```
$ python -c 'print("A"*0x1fe + "\n\t" + "B"*100)' | ./detab
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
    BBBBï¿½BBBBBBBBBBBB%
```

We get some weirdness so we probably overran the buffer, but its strange we don't get 100 Bs or a segmentation fault. Looking at how are decompiler sees the stack and we see why this isn't a trivial buffer overflow:

![stack according to decompiler](images/jackel-tab-vacc-stack.png)

When we overrun the buffer (here it's `stream` at `rbp-0x220`), it runs into other variables we are using in the loop, `var_4h` and `var_8h`.  The only times characters are written to the buffer are when `var_4h` is 0 or 1, when overflowing the buffer with Bs `var_4h` is overwritten to 0x42 and the buffer never progresses. Looking at it in gdb and breaking at `fgetc`:

```

We want to overwrite `0x004015c4`, the return address of `vaccinate`, but we get stuck at when we overwrite `var_4h`, here at `0x7fffffffdf4c`. But if we change our payload to write newlines right before it is set to overwrite `var_4h`, detab will overwrite `var_4h` with 1 *after* we overwrite it with a bad value and we can keep overflowing the buffer:

```

Thankfully detab has a nice `print_flag` function at `0x004011d6`, so to complete the challenge:
